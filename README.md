## Analysis

### The purpose of this challenge was to compare the weather data for different months to present to W. Avy. Since we wanted to open up a new business, we have to factor in all risks depending on the weather. We used SQLAlchemy along with Python and Panda functions to get the results.

## Results

* ### In the June results, one can see that the average temperature was 74.94 degrees.

* ### In the December results, one can see that the average temperature was 71.04 degrees

* ### As a result of both analysis, one can determine that the month of June has a higher advantage of being more busy for the business, but December still has a chance of having customers since the temperature isn't too cold. The max temperature in December is not too far from the max temperature from June.

## Summary

### One can determine that this business will be running all year round. The shops would not have to close in the winter time because the temperature is still good enough. This venture would not end up closing down and if one runs it correctly, it can even expand. Two additional queries I would run would be for the amount of precipitation for both months and I would also focus on the other months instead of just June and December. I would also like to run a query on the different stations as well. I would like to see this business succeed with the best data available.
